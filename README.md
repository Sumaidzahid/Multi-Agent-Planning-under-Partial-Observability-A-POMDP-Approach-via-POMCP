# Multi-Agent-POMDP-via-POMCP
This research presents a decentralized navigation framework for multi-agent systems operating in partially observable grid environments. Each agent independently models its decision process as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and employs Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning (POMCP) for online, real-time action selection.


Note: main.py Runs the whole project
